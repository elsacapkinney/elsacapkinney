Ingredients 
</b>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Cup of Butter</li>
<li>2 Cups of Brown Sugar</li>
<li>3 Eggs</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon of Vanilla</li>
<li>1 1/2 Cup of Chunky Peanut Butter</li>
<li>5 Cups of Quick Cooking Oats</li>
<li>6 Ounces of Plain M&Ms</li>
<li>6 Ounces of White Chocolate Chips</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Directions
</h2>
<ol>
<li>You will need an large mixing bowl. And an army of cookie sheets.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees</li>
<li>Cream together butter and sugar.</li>
<li>Add peanut butter and beat until somewhat fluffy</li>
<li>Combine eggs into mixture.</li>
<li>Add oats in small portions until they are completely combined.</li>
<li>To make regular sized cookies, drop by tablespoon onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Or if your dough allows, roll into balls and place on the baking sheet.</li>
<li>Smash your balls or drop down with a fork or spoon (these dont flatten out as they bake, but get terrifically chewy!</li>
<li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. Depends on your oven and your desired doneness. I like mine a little crispy, so I go for 15 minutes. </li>
</ol>

<h2>
Notes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can mix in anything of your choice here...possibilities are endless! I usually do M&M's and dark chocolate chips, but I thought I'd mix it up.</li>
<li>FYI this a hand mixing job, this will kill your electric mixer since the dough is SUPER thick(and you might work up a sweat mixing these).</li>
</ul>
